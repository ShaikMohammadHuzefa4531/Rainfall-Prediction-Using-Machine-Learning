# Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging a Gradient Boosting model. By analyzing historical weather data, we can forecast future rainfall, which is crucial for agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness.

Features
Data Collection: Historical weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

Machine Learning Model: Implemented using Gradient Boosting for high accuracy predictions.

Flask Web Application: A user-friendly web interface for submitting weather data and receiving predictions.

Prediction Accuracy: Evaluation metrics to measure the accuracy of predictions.

Visualization: Graphs and charts to visualize predicted rainfall.

Model Details
The model is trained using a Gradient Boosting algorithm, which combines multiple weak learners to form a strong predictor, enhancing accuracy and robustness.
